The goal of this project is to provide a web-service to convert chinese characters into chinese romanization.
As many of you have already known, chinese language is a character based language. Each character can have multiple
pronunciation, in one context, it is read in on way, in another context, the same character is read in another way.
Currently, this service just ignore this and pick one sound randomly. I am planning to fix this by introducing
context/PhraseTable to this service. But I don't have time now, I may fix it in (not so) near future.
